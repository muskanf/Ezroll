# Edzroll: Redesigning the Class Registration Portal

Ezroll is a project focused on redesigning the class registration portal to improve the user experience for students and faculty. Our goal is to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that streamlines the process of registering for classes and managing course schedules.

## Project Overview
- Our team conducted research to identify pain points and areas for improvement in the current class registration portal.
- We gathered feedback from students and faculty to understand their needs and preferences.
- Based on our research and feedback, we designed a new interface for the class registration portal that was more intuitive and user-friendly.
- We implemented the new design and tested it with a group of users to ensure that it met their needs and expectations.
- Once the new design was finalized, we launched the updated class registration portal for all users.

## Key Features
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface: The new design will be easy to navigate and understand, making it simple for users to find and register for classes.
- Streamlined registration process: We will simplify the process of registering for classes, reducing the number of steps and making it faster and more efficient.
- Improved course search: Users will be able to search for courses using a variety of criteria, making it easier to find the classes they need.
- Enhanced schedule management: The new portal will include tools for managing course schedules, allowing users to easily add, drop, or swap classes.

With Ezroll, we aim to improve the class registration experience for students and faculty, making it easier and more efficient to manage course schedules. By redesigning the class registration portal, we hope to enhance the overall educational experience at our institution.
